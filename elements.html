								<h3>My Background</h3>
								<p>
									My name is Carla, and technology has always fascinated me --- it's like a puzzle waiting to be solved<em> and I'm pretty good at puzzles.</em><br>
									I began my journey exploring the realms of <b>videogames development</b>, and that's where I discovered my <b>love for programming</b>. <br>
									The initial struggle turned at some point into a small pay for the satisfaction of watching a program that I built come to life.<br>
								<b>It made every struggle worthwhile.</b><br>
								My story took a small turn when I ventured later into <b>computer science</b> aiming to get deeper knowledge on programming, and <i>python</i> quickly became my programming language of choice--<em>the sleekness of the snake symbolizing the elegance of its syntax.</em><br>
								Yet, that wasn't the end of the story <i>(I'm almost done... for now)</i>, a casual YouTube stroll introduced me to the world of <b>data analytics</b>, opening up an exhilarating new chapter in my journey.<br>
							<b>And here we are.</b><br>
							Amid this technological odyssey, I was refining my soft-skills while working in various people-related roles. These experiences offered me opportunities to develop my capabilities and collaborate with diverse teams which  <b>I will always appreciate.</b>
